 Can brain freeze actually cause damage if it lasts too long?  Worms in your

urethra, horns growing out of your skin, and wait, can you actually pee forever?

Huh, today we're diving into the internet's most unhinged medical questions.

Yes, the ones that are too weird for WebMD and maybe too awkward to ask your

actual doctor.  Buckle up, this is going to get weird, wild, and medically

fascinating.  Alright, let's dive right in.  I read about a worm that swims up

the urethra and has spikes. How do doctors


========== The 2-nd segment of the split (510 words) ==========


remove that?  It is called Candiru, which I don't know if I'm pronouncing that

right or not, but the word on  the street basically is if you jump in the water,

it could swim up your urethra, aka your P-tube,  and then kind of latch in on

there. Super, super rare, but it does exist. If it does go up the  urethra, you

need to have it surgically removed. If I slowly drank water indefinitely, could

I  slowly pee indefinitely? So technically, yes, you're supposed to be drinking

water all day long.  It's really


========== The 3-rd segment of the split (504 words) ==========


good for you. It keeps us hydrated, but our kidneys can only process a certain

amount  of water over a period of time. If I drink a gallon of water in an hour,

it's going to overtax  my system and it's going to start shifting my

electrolytes in a bad way. It's going to dilute  out, say, sodium, potassium,

chloride, all the kind of simple basic electrolytes that we have.  But once you

start doing that, there's something called water toxicity, where people actually

can  go into cardiac arrhythmias and


========== The 4-th segment of the split (510 words) ==========


actually cardiac death. Typically, our body can manage about a  liter of water

an hour. Hey, doctor, if someone receives a blood transfusion,  then they need

to have their DNA taken or tested for whatever reason. Will the donor's DNA

identity  show up in the test results? Identity theft is not a joke, Jim. That

is a very good logical question,  and the likelihood is no. Well, most of the

time, your DNA testing is done by, say, a cheek swab,  so cells there, or a

tissue swab, or a tissue biopsy, or saliva,


========== The 5-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


but typically not done on  your red blood cells. So what's happening is when

somebody gets a blood transfusion,  you're separating out the blood components.

Somebody actually gets a blood transfusion.  What they're probably meaning in

general is that they got a packed red blood cell transfusion.  I know someone

with yellow spots on their breast area. No bruises per se, but yellow spots

above  and below the nipple. Any idea what that might be? You can have a bruise

that's healing, and at the  later stages of


========== The 6-th segment of the split (506 words) ==========


its healing, when it's greenish, it could turn kind of yellow. Then you have

this  other question where there's specific spots, and that could be xanthoma,

which is basically a  collection of fat underneath the tissue, and it's usually

related to high cholesterol. So if somebody  has familial hypercholesterolemia

or their diet is very, very high in cholesterol, you can start  having skin

deposits. What is a cutaneous horn, and how do you treat it? Hold it. This is

getting  confusing. It is a horn-like


========== The 7-th segment of the split (502 words) ==========


growth out of your skin. It's made up mostly of keratin. Keratin,  like your

fingernails. It's most likely benign, but sometimes these could potentially be

cancerous.  They're removed by a dermatologist, most likely, and usually they're

sent off for biopsy to make  sure that they are not cancerous. But most people

don't like them, and they're unsightly,  so you can get them removed. What's the

best way to treat parasites in the body? Does a glass of  kefir with a clove of

garlic help against them?


========== The 8-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


Parasites, no, we're not talking about any X  that's bothering you, but we're

talking about tapeworms, pinworms, roundworms, giardia.  These type of creatures

are basically parasites, and how do we get them out of our body? Well,  we have

anti-parasitic medications like albendazole, mabenzazole. There's a list of them

that we typically use to help eradicate them out of our body. Some are in our GI

tract,  sometimes they're in our liver. There are sometimes that they go to our

brain,  all different types of


========== The 9-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


parasites. Clove of garlic, very helpful for your gut and helpful  for your

body. Probably not strong enough. I have a question. I was diagnosed with autism

at the age  of five, but as I grew older, it's become less of a problem. Are

there worse conditions to have  when you are an adult versus being a kid? So

yes, and you're not alone. Autism is a spectrum,  depending on your individual

situation, your symptoms, or how you express your process can  change over time.

Say somebody gets brain injury, a trauma,


========== The 10-th segment of the split (510 words) ==========


or a stroke, and there's injury to the  brain tissue as you're older, that area

of the brain can now be a central area where a seizure  can start from. And now

you've actually began having seizures at an older age. Another example  would be

some psychiatric conditions, maybe in your twenties, such as schizophrenia. So

you're  doing fine in your single digits and teen years, and then all of a

sudden into your twenties,  somebody might exhibiting some abnormal behavior,

paranoid behavior, having auditory or


========== The 11-th segment of the split (508 words) ==========


visual  hallucinations, and then they get diagnosed with schizophrenia. So moral

of the story,  bodies change, medical conditions change. That's why it's really

important to check in with your  doctor. Why does it hurt so much when I hit the

tip of my elbow or pinky toe? Son of a nutcracker.  It's because nature is

cruel. No, it's because of the anatomy itself. So say your elbow, your funny

bone. Well, it's actually your ulnar nerve. And the reason why it hurts so bad

when you hit that area  is because


========== The 12-th segment of the split (509 words) ==========


your nerve is pretty much exposed. Now, related to your pinky toe, that pinky

toe  packs a lot of pain because it's small, it's exposed, it is not as easily

moved out of the way.  So it does take a lot of hit. And then because it's your

foot or say foot and hand, there's a  lot of nerve endings to that area, which

can cause significant amount of pain when injured.  And what causes snoring and

how do I stop it?  Snoring basically happens because of airflow going over

tissue. So if we have excess tissue in


========== The 13-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


our  upper airway, maybe we have too much body fat or anatomically, we have

really large tonsils.  Snoring is just a turbulent sound of noise. Whatever

reason that you need to get better sleep,  check out Do Not Disturb at

LifeHappens.com or on Amazon. It's one of my personal favorite  supplements and

I use it almost nightly. Can brain freeze actually cause damage if it lasts  too

long or is it harmless? Nope, it feels brutal, but brain freeze does not cause

permanent damage.  We've all experienced it, that


========== The 14-th segment of the split (508 words) ==========


really good ice cream or something really cold in our mouth that  we down super

fast and all of a sudden, like the pain, the freeze, the headache, it happens to

everybody. It's due to a nerve on the top of the heart palate related to your

trigeminal nerve.  It's a branch off of that, which is your maxillary nerve. And

it's basically called sphenopalentine  ganglionaralgia. Who came up with that?

So what happens is because of the cold, it constricts the  blood vessels in that

area, sends a signal to the


========== The 15-th segment of the split (511 words) ==========


nerve saying, oh, there's pain and gives you that  signal, kind of a wrong

signal. But unfortunately that's what ends up happening. Take your thumb  and

push it to the heart palate and just push up. It'll warm up the nerve and calm

the symptoms  down a lot faster. Why when I yawn, do I lose my hearing? As you

yawn, it has to do with your  eustachian tubes. The tube connecting your middle

ear to kind of like your posterior pharynx area.  And it has to do with airflow.

But when you do that, it can muffle the


========== The 16-th segment of the split (508 words) ==========


sound a little bit relating to  the tympanic membrane and the basically transfer

of sound. So that's why it might be a little  muffled or decreased hearing. So

sometimes when I don't hear something correctly, I might use that  as an excuse

that I was yawning. Microplastics are in everything. What's the best way to get

rid of  them? Oatmeal, that's what I heard. You can't really completely get rid

of these microplastics.  There are a lot of things, but things that you can do

to minimize them in your life


========== The 17-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


basically is try  not to drink out of plastic bottles. Use a filter to filter

out your water. Avoid foods that are in  plastic. Even like soda bottles. Think

about that. We always think about water, but people who drink  soda, same thing.

They're in a lot of plastic. Why soluble fiber? Why oatmeal? Because it has beta

glucan. And so beta glucan has been studied and found that it helps with binding

and getting rid  of these bad plastics and chemicals out of our bodies.

Biohacking that I've seen where people


========== The 18-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


are getting their blood filtered to try to get these plastics out. If you're

interested in that  video, please let me know in the comments. How many blood

bags are needed on average during a  surgery? We got a bleeder. So many

different types of surgeries and so many potential risks for the  surgery,

depending on what's happening. Meaning if I'm having my gallbladder removed

versus my appendix  removed versus I'm having my intestines removed, these are

all different risk type of surgeries.  And depending on


========== The 19-th segment of the split (512 words) ==========


the vasculature that's around, you may or may not need blood around. So a

surgeon  doing the surgery will potentially know what the risk is, but anywhere

between two and 10 bags of  blood, which each bag is a pint. And we're talking

red blood cells, but if you're having a clotting  issue, they might have FFP,

fresh frozen plasma or platelets around as well, or cryoprecipitate.  There's a

lot of different things that could happen. I've heard delivering a baby is

equivalent  to breaking several bones at once.


========== The 20-th segment of the split (511 words) ==========


What's the most painful bone to break or pain a human can  experience? Is it

childbirth? Childbirth is definitely high on the list that is up there.  What

we've seen and what people and patients have said is that nerve pain is awful.

Specifically  something like trigeminal neuralgia, which is basically facial

pain that is just a nerve gone  haywire and the treatment of it, unfortunately,

doesn't minimize the pain as much. Other painful  experiences that people have,

kidney stones, people have a significant


========== The 21-th segment of the split (510 words) ==========


amount of pain.  Big laundry list of things that are extremely painful. We've

done a few videos on the most  painful medical issues that somebody can

experience. I'll put in a link in the description  below. What is the most

painful thing you've experienced? Let me know in the comments.  What is priapism

and is there a way to treat it without going to the doctor? Priapism is a

unwanted,  unsexually stimulated, prolonged erection. So what can you do? Get to

the hospital,  needs to be evaluated. It needs to


========== The 22-th segment of the split (509 words) ==========


be evaluated if it is high flow versus low flow. Is it arterial  versus a venous

problem? Typically after about four to six hours, that's when things start going

bad. If you have to get to the hospital ASAP, it is an emergency. What's the

craziest thing  you heard a doctor or medical staff say to a patient? Hello,

Deputy Chief Wunsch. You've  aged. So really interesting. I see my own patients.

So the only time I would hear it is like walking  by a room, but I've had a

staff member basically yelling at a


========== The 23-th segment of the split (510 words) ==========


patient to stop throwing their open  urine container at them. Like, oh my gosh,

there's unique things that general public don't know that  happens to staff

members at a hospital. And that's one of them. If you ever had a staff member

say something kind of off to you that made you think twice, let me know in the

comments. Maybe  I'll make a whole video about it. Wow. These are really great

questions, really entertaining for me  and hopefully you guys will learn

something. So as usual, do me a favor, check
